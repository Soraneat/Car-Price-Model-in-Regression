Car Price Model in Regression (LR, SVR, and RFR)

## Dataset
The ”Car Price” dataset, which is a collection of car information in the US market, was obtained an open source datasets. Each requirement’s specifications are clearly displayed in 26 columns of features.

## Abstract
A foreign automobile business decides to enter the US market and construct automobiles in the United States in order to compete with their American and European peers. The goal of this study is to explore the model of automobile prices using the dataset’s available independent variables. This study is to find the best algorithm that can produce an excellent model using a regression model. Therefore, we employ three distinct algorithms: linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR), with R2, RMSE, and MAE as assessment criteria to figure out the result. RFR was determined to be the best model, since it had both the greatest R-squared score and the lowest error rate among the others. Furthermore, RFR (Randon Forest Regression) is used for making prediction
